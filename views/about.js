    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      This is more than just a restaurant finder — it's a love letter to St.
      Louis. From the Hill to Cherokee Street, Delmar to Downtown, we’re here to
      help you explore the flavors that make this city unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shine a spotlight on local spots that deserve the hype — no chains, no
      corporate nonsense. Just the real ones: mom-and-pop diners, late-night
      eats, food trucks with fire menus, and tucked-away joints only locals know
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born and built in STL, we’re on a mission to connect people with the
      city’s most iconic and underground eats. Whether you’re new in town or a
      day-one native, we’re here to help you taste the city, one neighborhood at
      a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Support local. Eat bold. Discover St. Louis.
