<!-- def statement -->

i want to build a application that can crowdsource information about things or places to goto in a small area. I want it to be alittle more intimate than something like a check-in app that is currently out there.

<!-- audience -->

anyone looking for local/smalll buisnesses in an area.

<!-- outline of content -->

1. really not sure what kind of pics or images i want.
   all i know is i want the navigation to be easy to navigate with clear instructions or descriptions.
2. functionality i want things to be easy to navigate and for information to be as accurate as possible, considering the type of webpage.
3. the purpose of my webpage is to give people that visit a chance to either leave good recommendations to places to visit, or for people to find non touristy places to spend time.
4. i want to solve the problem of one, big businesses from taking advantage of check-in sites/review sites. and two, for people that are looking for local good places to be able to find these places, and leave a good review if they wanted to.
5. as far as attributes for the website, im really bad at this. im not sure how the aesthetic should look at the moment.
